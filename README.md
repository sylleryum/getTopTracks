## Why this is useful

* Suppose you are looking for new songs/artists/albums, if you receive single song recommendations, you simply listen to it and that's it. Now let's suppose you receive the recommendation of jeff wayne's musical version of the war of the worlds which is 94:54 long, or you have a large number of artists to listen to see if you like it or not. So how can you decide what to listen to from these albums/artists?
* **This application tries to help in such scenarios giving you the best evaluated songs (up to 5) of artists/albums provided (see video above for demonstration)**

## Full description/features

* Simply press in "Get started" to authorize this app to create playlists/add songs to your spotify<br>
* This application let's you paste several artists and/or albums and then adds to the selected or created Spotify playlist
* If there are songs duplicates between pasted artist and the album it justs adds the song once (E.g if one pastes artist A and Album B from artist A and 2 of the 3 top songs from album and artist are the same, these 2 songs are added only once)
* You can either create a new playlist or add songs to an existing one<br>
* Paste song name (preferably in the format of artist name - song name)<br>
* One song per line<br>
